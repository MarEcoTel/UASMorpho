# UASMorpho
Code to process, measure, and analyze UAS photogrammetry data. R scripts and the protocol document are specific to the operations of METR and our data management systems. They may however still be useful to others when developing your own workflow. Both Whalength and morphometrix measurement software are included here. We currently use morphometrix.
