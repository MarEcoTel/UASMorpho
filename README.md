# UASMorpho
Code to process, measure, and analyze UAS photogrammetry data. R scripts and the protocol document are specific to the operations of METR and our data management systems. They may however still be useful to others when developing your own workflow. Both Whalength and morphometrix measurement software are included here. We currently use morphometrix/collatrix. More info on the software/code shown here may be found at preexisting github repositories (see below).

Whalength code is used from an existing github repo with help from Jordan Lerma to meet our specific needs: https://github.com/EvaLeunissen/Whalength | https://github.com/jordkl/Whalength

Morphometrix code is used from an existing github repo: https://github.com/wingtorres/morphometrix

Collatrix code is used from an existing github repo: https://github.com/cbirdferrer/collatrix

Preparing new LIDAR units also requires use of the following github repo: https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards
