# Contribution Guidelines

## Reporting issues

- **Search for existing issues.** Please check to see if someone else has reported the same issue.
- **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system and version, browser and version. Also, include steps to reproduce the bug.

## Project Setup
Refer to the [README](README.md).

## Code Style

This code generally tries to adhere to [PEP-8]( <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>) standards for style, howevever we emphasize the PEP-8 team's point that "A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds". From their website...

*Some other good reasons to ignore a particular guideline:*

* When applying the guideline would make the code less readable, even for someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP.
* To be consistent with surrounding code that also breaks it (maybe for historic reasons) -- although this is also an opportunity to clean up someone else's mess (in true XP style).
* Because the code in question predates the introduction of the guideline and there is no other reason to be modifying that code.
* When the code needs to remain compatible with older versions of Python that don't support the feature recommended by the style guide.

## Testing
